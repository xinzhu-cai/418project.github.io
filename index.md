### Summary

We implemented a concurrent extensible hash table library in C++ including three versions: a lock-free
extensible hash table using CAS, which is based on a split-order list, a coarse-grained
lock-based version, and a fine-grained lock-based version based on a two-level locking
mechanism. Given the experimental results on a 12-core shared memory multiprocessor, we
demonstrate that the lock-free version is more efficient and scalable in most cases and is
significantly better than lock-based ones under heavy or skewed workloads.
